<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">DyGraph is a simple
2D graph visualization package. It is built in Java, deployed as an
applet and registered as a Facebook app. With DyGraph, users can
expect to:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">[1] create a
moderately-sized (~80+ vertices) graph consisting of their most
relevant friends and connections.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">[2] easily detect
important &ldquo;communities&rdquo; among peers based not only on the
Facebook Networks each person belongs to, but also on the underlying
structure of the graph. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">[3] (this is a less
immediate goal) run several vertex-based graph algorithms such as
centrality measures, PageRank and clustering coefficient. Wouldn't it
be cool if, by using bigger vertices to represent friends with
greater PageRank scores, one could visually tell which one of their
friends act as 'hubs' of communication in their social networks?</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">There are also a
few things to keep in mind when developing this project:</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">[1] Less cluttering
is more usability! While we probably won't be able to compete with
the functionality of TouchGraph, we should at least create an app
that takes a much simpler, user- driven approach. If possible, we
shouldn't even have a traditional file bar, tool box, etc. (or have
only a subtle, semi-transparent icon that expands when moused over).</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">[2] Make it work,
then worry about making it optimal (I believe Knuth once said:
&ldquo;Premature optimization is the root of all evil&rdquo;).</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">This project should
be ready for release by the end of 2 weeks&mdash;after the first
week, all of the separate modules should be complete; after the
second week, all of the modules should be combined, and all major
bugs fixed.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">- Web page: this
will house the applet. Nothing too fancy here, just some HTML&mdash;
however, we will also need some Javascript in order to redirect to
Facebook for authentication, and then receive data from Facebook in
the form of an access token for this to be a proper Facebook app.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in">- SQL database:
still trying to decide if we need this. Will be useful if users want
to save their graphs so they can be opened later. Let's hold off on
this until week 2.</P>
